## Scifi Amsterdam Book club app

Scifi Amsterdam is a book club application where people can become members, choose new books to read for the whole bookclub, rate and comment on books, and react with emojis on comments. This application has been developed to be used by my friends and I in our book club.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to log in to my book club
- As a user I want to see the current book we are reading
- As a user I want to see a history of the books we have read
- As a user I want to be able to post the new book we are going to read
- As a user I want to be able to rate the books we have read
- As a user I want to comment on the books we have read

Still to come:

- As a user I want to be able to react on comments with emojis
- As a user I want to get notified when a new book to read gets chosen
- As a user I want to be able to edit my profile

## To try the app:

Clone the Front End from: https://github.com/LaurynasKraujalis/FE-book-club-app

Clone the Back End from: https://github.com/LaurynasKraujalis/BE-book-club-app

Run NPM install for both.
Run NPM start for the Front End.
Run node index.js for the Back End.

This app is intended to be a Progressive Web App, so please view it in your dev tools as 'phone view'.

Now you can use the app from your local host.

## Deployed version
